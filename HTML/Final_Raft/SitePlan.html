            Here is a small map of the campsite that you will be spending the night near. All of the rapids are connected
            to one river but each part is at a different location up stream meaning every group will be able to meet up with one another.
            This means that Auntie June can go on the Ragged Rapids while five year old Mac can go on the Rabbit Rapids! 
            While most other companies go through different branches of the rivers White Water Rapids is lucky enough to be able to keep everyone together.
            This way people can build bonds that last a lifetime.
            <br>
            We would like to thank all of those who have come with us in the past to support what we do. Bringing people together is what we work for.
            Thanks to you we will also be able to open up an all year round camping option for those who want to hike the nearby mountains and swimming for the fish of the family.
            We hope to see you all!
            Coming July 2023!
