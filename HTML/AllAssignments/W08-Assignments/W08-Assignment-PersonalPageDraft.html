    <h1>Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <p>For this webpage I am going to use it to display some of my old art creating a digital portfolio.</p>
    <p>There will be multiple pages for items and prints for sale(Not really atm). I would also list when commisions are open. My main goal for this page is to display how I would structure a page like this and in the future I would want to try making a page just like this for a friend of mine.</p>
    <p>So for one page I would organize all the past work I have done and would shrink the images slightly and upload a smaller size then the original so I can tell when an image has been stolen. I would also want to display if any prints are available of those pieces beneath the images. 
        The other page would list commission options as well as the different prices for different commissions. For instance one would be sketch pieces which would only be $10 and would display some of my physical and digital sketch pieces. I would then list physical artwork pieces and list the commission price ranging from lined pieces, flat pieces and shaded pieces.
        finally completed pieces with complete backgrounds. I would then want to inform people that physical pieces and digital pieces will vary in timeframe depending on the option the person chose. I would then also allow someone to choose the medium that they would like for the piece.
        Next column would list the digital options ranging from sketch to flats to complete shaded etc. Just like physical however the price range would be less since there are less material costs in the end. Taking into account any mediums that are used like ink etc. This would also display any digital work I have created before. 
        Finally I would list any 3d work either models or physical masks or projects I have made in the past. Either in cad design, z brush or by hand etc. This would follow a similar outline as the other two columns. 
        As for a quote on quote link tree I would create a page with different social media links similarly to what the application link tree provides for the users
