    <h2>Maya Thompson</h2>
    <p>I am a computer science major with a minor in animal science. 
    In my free time I enjoy playing videogames, reading, and drawing.</p>
    <p>I currently work in analytics.
    Something that I love about BYU-Idaho are the teachers and student you get to meet.
    An advantage I see the web design is that every business now has to have a page of some sort as well as a social media presence.</p>
